<script>
// Create the constructor for a Person object
function Person( name ) {
this.name = name||"No Name";
}
// Create a new User object constructor
function User(password) {
// Notice that this does not support graceful overloading/inheritance
// e.g. being able to call the super class constructor
this.password = password;
};
// The User object inherits all of the Person object's methods
User.prototype = new Person();
var NewUser = new User("pwd");

alert("New User Name:" + NewUser.name);//inherited from person
alert("New User Password: " + NewUser.password);
//console.log(NewUser.name);
//console.log("New User Password: " + NewUser.password);
NewUser.name="Ahmed";//inherited from person
alert("New User Name:" + NewUser.name);

/***
The most important line in the example is User.prototype = new Person();.
Let’s look in depth at what exactly this means. 
User is a reference to the function constructor of the User object.
new Person() creates a new Person object, using the Person constructor.
You set the result of this as the value of the User constructor’s prototype. 
This means that anytime you do new User(), 
-->the new User object will have all the methods that the Person object
had when you did new Person().
